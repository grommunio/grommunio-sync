===============================

Fixes:

* S/MIME signed emails sent from iOS had shown no recipient
* Cleanup search folders from store created by Find operation


grommunio-sync 2.2 (2025-04-15)
===============================

Fixes:

* Allow for successful synchronization when logged in via altname (turning it
  into email address internally)
* TimeZoneStruct wDayOfWeek and wDay were erroneously switched whan calculating
  DST start and end, which has been fixed.
* Adjust all day events to midnight only if a TZ definition was saved with the
  message. The server timezone should not be applied in this case, because if
  no TZ is there, starttime/endtime of an event should be midnight already.
* Apply server TZ to allday appointments with non GMT start times.
